Define global vars: BUILD_DIR=build, BINARY_NAME=pplx, MAIN_FILE=main.go\n2. Implement default task that runs build\n3. Implement build task with:\n   - mkdir -p {{.BUILD_DIR}}\n   - go build -o {{.BUILD_DIR}}/{{.BINARY_NAME}} {{.MAIN_FILE}}\n   - sources: **/*.go, go.mod, go.sum\n   - generates: {{.BUILD_DIR}}/{{.BINARY_NAME}}\n4. Implement install task with auto-detection:\n   - Always run clean and build first\n   - Check if GOPATH is set and GOPATH/bin exists\n   - If yes, install to /bin/{{.BINARY_NAME}}\n   - If no, install to /usr/local/bin/{{.BINARY_NAME}}\n   - Use install -m 0755 for proper permissions\n5. Implement clean task to remove build/ directory and coverage files\n6. Port additional Makefile targets: test, test-coverage, fmt, lint, deps, run\n7. Implement verify task that chains build + test\n8. Implement all task that runs clean, build, and test\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n- Keep build/ directory (not bin/) to match existing convention\n- Build from root main.go (not cmd/ subdirectory)\n- Use shell script for install auto-detection logic\n- Include proper task descriptions","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-10T22:31:28.550209-03:00","created_by":"adrielmartins","updated_at":"2026-02-10T22:31:58.574597-03:00","closed_at":"2026-02-10T22:31:58.574597-03:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"perplexity-cli-rrt.1","depends_on_id":"perplexity-cli-rrt","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-10T22:31:28.550858-03:00","created_by":"adrielmartins"}]}
